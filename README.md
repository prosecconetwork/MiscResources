This repository contains additional resources to [Thesaurus Rex](http://ngrams.ucd.ie/therex2/).

### The Non-Official Characterization (NOC) list
The NOC list contains information about fictional and real characters. Read more about the NOC list on: https://github.com/prosecconetwork/The-NOC-List

### Stereotypical properties of categories
The file ''properties_of_categories.txt'' contains stereotypical properties of human categories (e.g. artist, scientist and hero). These properties were obtained by the approach described in Veale and Hao (2008).

### Properties and their neighbouring properties
Veale (2011) presents an approach for linking properties to their neighbouring properties. The links produced by the approach are provided in the file ''AS_pred_pred sim.idx''.

### Expanded and weighted properties
Using the above resources (i.e. the NOC list, stereotypical properties of categories and links between properties), new properties were added to nouns (characters and human categories). Moreover, weights have been assigned to initial and newly added properties. The expansion and weighting approach of the properties is described in Alnajjar et al. (2017). The output of the approach is given in ''expanded_weights.txt''.
